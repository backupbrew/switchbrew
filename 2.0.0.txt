==Kernel==
* KPoolManager was majorly rewritten.
** Added MAC crypto on heap-chunk headers, to protect against DMA attacks (same as 3DS).

* KHandleTable default size was improved from 40 to 1024.
* The code to create a bigger handle table in allocated pool memory has been removed.
* KHandleTable spinlock was given core-suspension logic.
* KHandleTable compresses 64-bit pointers into 32-bit offsets.

* KAddressSpace was renamed to KDeviceAddressSpace.

* KSharedMemory now maintains a list of every map (each 0x20-byte entry).
** To do cleanup of mapped shared memories when a process is killed.

* KSharedMemory no longer references the owning KProcess.
** Instead it stores the pid, so that the process can be freed even though the shared memory still exists.

* KInterruptEvent changed:
** Creation doesn't use KIrqSingleton directly anymore.
** Instead it allocates a 0x20-byte entry, and then uses KIrqSingleton.
** Probaly to do better cleanup.

* Size-checks >= 0x180000000 was added to a bunch of syscalls.

* Restriction on debug SVCs were loosened to support [[creport]].

* svcReadWriteRegister was extended with more registers.

* Added blacklist on [[NPDM]] kernel descriptor memory mappings.

* svcGetInfo was extended with more id0's.

* Process exception dispatching was implemented/improved.

* Support for processes with 39-bit AddressSpaceType was added.
** Includes required IPC changes.

* On startup, kernel now calls SMC id1 0xC3000007 with the kernel memory range start and size.

* AArch64 exception vector for "SError interrupt" was implemented.

* Kernel stacks are now allocated with a slabheap.

* While 1.0.0 had two pools with size 0, now it uses all three. The last one size is calculated dynamically to fit all the built-in sysmodules, and it's now protected by the kernel carveout.
