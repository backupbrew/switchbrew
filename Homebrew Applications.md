## Installing

Applications are installed by copying the necessary files directly to
the `switch/` folder in the root of the SD card, or in a subdirectory of
`switch/`, in which case said subfolder must be named identically to its
executable. Normally the former should be used. The latter should be
used if the application uses anything from FS current-working-directory
(directory where the NRO is located). Applications come with the
following:

  - `[appname].nro`: The executable.

The Homebrew Menu will scan the SD card for all `.nro` files, but will
only display an icon for those who have one according to the format
described above. You can also freely navigate the filesystem to select
an application.

Icon/metadata for each application is loaded from data embedded in the
NRO (custom assets section), if
available.
